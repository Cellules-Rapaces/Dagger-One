## What are server settings?
![DCS Server settings](elodf_dcs_server_settings.jpg)

## How are initial fuel levels set?
For the moment, using the same settings as on the **canon BFR competition** and/or the **Dogfighters** server.

They must allow 5 minutes of full afterburner/full throttle to each aircraft.

This point will be studied and documented more finely to take into account the different consumptions according to the altitudes. This is to ensure an even fairer balance.

## How do I know if the first merge happened?
This point can be tricky, especially for newcomers. We recommend ensuring a crossing as close as possible.

Failing that, when you see that the two planes have started to turn around having made more than 90Â° of course change... it means that the merge has passed!

Be chivalrous and start with a helmet crossing!

## What is ELO?
The ELO represents the strength of a competitor and makes it possible to classify/compare players.
This principle comes from the game of chess. Consult the Wikipedia article [ELO ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

## What to do if the AutoSpwan script "bugs"?
You can still do a manual respawn. Become a spectator, and reslot on your plane (coordinate with the opponent). You will see that from the moment you have a match in progress, the server will not allow you to join another slot.

## I can fight any plane with any plane?
Yes.

However, pay attention to the balance of the match. It is up to each player to choose/manage which aircraft they use and battle against. It also requires agreeing with the adversary of the moment. There is no imposition/obligation. But keep in mind that the ELO calculation for the aircraft you are using only takes into account the match result and the opponent's ELO on the aircraft they are using. The calculation of the ELO does not take into account the type of aircraft confronted.

## Who organizes and administers ELO Dogfight?
**CoubyStark**, under the banner of **Cellules Rapaces**, eSport team of the **community of Air and Space Force gamers**.

## What if both planes run out of fuel and manage to land?
Be **fairplay**! By audio/chat exchange do you mean to eject at the same time. This will make a "null" round which will have to be replayed.

## Is impersonation or identity conflict possible?
No.
Server-level results all include player UCIDs. This is a unique identifier associated with the player's DCS account.
Results displayed at the website level do not expose this UCID. These are based on the nickname. However as soon as there is a nickname conflict the administrator is warned to manually deal with the situation. It will adjust the nickname of the last player with this one (adding a hint).

## Is it possible to modify my player nickname displayed in the results?
Yes.
To do this, contact **CoubyStark** on the Rapace Discord.
