In short #
The ELO Dogfight server offers you to carry out 1 against 1 gun fights, with the plane of your choice, H24, 7/7. The matches are played in 3 points (possible results: 3-0 or 2-1). All match results are saved on the server, and an &amp;ldquo;ELO&amp;rdquo; is calculated for each pilot, per aircraft used, based on the result of each match.</description></item><item><title>Rules</title><link>https://dagger-one.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/regles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2022 08:49:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dagger-one.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/regles/</guid><description>Some rules to be respected by any participant in ELO Dogfight.

How do I know if the first merge happened? #
This point can be tricky, especially for newcomers. We recommend ensuring a crossing as close as possible.
Failing that, when you see that the two planes have started to turn around having made more than 90Â° of course change&amp;hellip; it means that the merge has passed!</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://dagger-one.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/contact/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Aug 2020 19:25:12 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://dagger-one.cellules-rapaces.fr/en/contact/</guid><description>This site is created and administered by FrÃ©dÃ©ric "CoubyStark" Coubard.
